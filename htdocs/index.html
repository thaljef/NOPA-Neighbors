                <p>
                    My wife and I have lived at 38 Cole Street since 2007.
                    We love looking at the beautiful buildings and meeting
                    all the wonderful people who live in this part of the NOrth
                    PAnhandle neighborhood. But sometimes, the wind and rain and
                    a few careless citizens make a mess.  It saddens us when we
                    see the neighborhood littered with trash and debris.  But
                    with your help, we’d like do something about it.

                    Using the <a href="#donate">button below</a>, you can
                    contribute to the NOPA Neighbors Fund.  Each time the Fund
                    reaches $300, I will use the money to hire day-laborers to
                    help me clean the neighborhood.  We’ll spend an entire day
                    removing trash, sweeping sidewalks, picking up dog poop,
                    pulling weeds, and whatever else needs to be done to keep
                    our streets safe and clean.

                    As residents and homeowners, I bet most of us wouldn’t mind
                    paying a little extra in city taxes or fees if we knew the
                    money would be spent for services in our neighborhood.

                <p>
                    100% of the NOPA Neighbors Fund will go towards cleaning the
                    area bounded by Schrader, Clayton, Fulton, and Fell Streets.
                    So your contribution will have a direct impact in your
                    immediate area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time, you’ll be helping to make the entire
                    neighborhood safer and more desirable.

                    This is not an official charity, organization, or institution.
                    I’m just a friendly neighbor trying to make our corner of
                    the world a little better.  I hope we’ll repeatedly load
                    the Fund so we can clean the neighborhood several times
                    a year.  But if the Fund does not reach the $300 goal within
                    3 months, I’ll refund all money to the donors.
