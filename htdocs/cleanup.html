                    <h1>Clean-up Details</h1>
                    <p>Thanks to your generous support, the NOPA Neighbors Fund has reached its goal!  So the first clean-up is scheduled for Saturday, November 6, starting at 8:00 am.  All are welcome to participate.  If the weather does not cooperate, it will be rescheduled for the following Saturday.</p>
                    <p>Between 9/26 and 10/23, the Fund recieved a total of $340 dollars from twelve wonderful donors.  $40 will be used to purchase equipment and supplies such as gloves, trash bags, brooms, et cetera. The remailing $300 will be used to pay three day-laborers for an eight hour shift. </p>
                    <p>The laborers and myself will work in teams of two to cover the designated area. We will sweep sidewalks, haul trash, pick-up dog poop and pull weeds. Any graffiti that we spot will be reported to the City.  We generally will NOT celan the streets or gutters -- we don't have enough time, and that work is best left to the machines anyway.</p>
                    <p>If you have any special requests, please <a href="contact.html">let me know</a> and we'll do our best to accommodate them. In the meantime, you can still donate to the NOPA Neighbors Fund.  Any contributions received after 10/23 will be applied toward the next clean-up.</p>
                    <p>And finally, if you'd like to remind your neighbors about the NOPA Neighbors Fund just send them a link to this web site, or give them the <a href="flier.pdf">flier</a>.
